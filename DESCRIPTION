Description: Implements a grid search algorithm with an adaptive zooming strategy 
    for global optimisation problems with multiple local optima. 
    The method recursively refines the search region around promising grid points, 
    providing reliable initial values for subsequent optimisation procedures. 
    The algorithm is computationally efficient in moderate- to high-dimensional settings.
